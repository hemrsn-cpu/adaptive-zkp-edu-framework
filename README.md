## 📌 Project Overview (ภาพรวมโครงการ)
This project proposes an **Adaptive Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Framework** designed to balance the trade-off between **verification cost** and **data privacy** for educational credentials.

In the era of PDPA and GDPR, verifying academic qualifications shouldn't require exposing sensitive personal data. This framework allows institutions to verify credentials (e.g., "Has a Bachelor's degree") without revealing unnecessary details (e.g., grades, exact graduation date), while dynamically adjusting the computational cost based on the verification context.

## 🎯 Key Objectives (วัตถุประสงค์หลัก)
1.  **Maximize Privacy:** Implement ZKP to enable "Proof without Disclosure."
2.  **Optimize Cost:** Develop an adaptive algorithm that selects the most efficient verification method based on security requirements.
3.  **Enhance Data Governance:** Align with international data protection standards (PDPA/GDPR).

## 🛠 Tech Stack (เทคโนโลยีที่ใช้)
- **Core Logic:** Python / Mathematics (Cryptography)
- **ZKP Libraries:** ZoKrates / snarkjs (Tentative)
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Framework:** (To be determined)

## 📖 Thesis Context
This repository is part of the Master of Science in Information and Communication Technology for Education (M.Sc. ICT) thesis.
